Before deploying to Engine, you will need to have the Engine Yard gem installed.  If you don't have that already installed, Studio will prompt you to install it before deploying to Engine Yard.  You will also need a Ruby on Rails project opened in Studio before you can proceed with the deployment.    </p>

<p>
After you have created an account/sign in, you will also need to log into the Engine Yard dashboard at <a class="external-link external-link" href="https://cloud.engineyard.com/dashboard" target="_blank">https://cloud.engineyard.com/dashboard</a> to setup an instance for your application.  Then you should be able to proceed and run the 'deploy app' command from studio.    </p>
</div>
<p>
After you have finished running through the wizard, the &quot;ey deploy&quot; command will run in the Studio terminal which deploys your project to Engine Yard.  After you have done the initial deployment to Engine Yard, clicking on the box icon again will allow you to select a number of Engine Yard commands.    </p>
