This is in contrast to web-based solutions that deliver functionality via an enhanced web view. Titanium, not wanting to be limited by the native web view, has engaged in a much deeper integration with the underlying platforms. This gives Titanium developers the ability to leverage native UI components &amp; services, as well as near-native performance, features you won't find in other cross-platform mobile development solution. In addition, you'll have access to other features like:    </p>\n<ul class=\" \"><li class=\" \"> <p>\nPlatform specific APIs    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nLocation-based services    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nSocial sharing    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nRich multimedia    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nOnline and on-device data    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nExtensibility    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nand much more!    </p>\n</li></ul> <p>\nTitanium empowers you to create immersive, full-featured applications that go beyond the boundaries of the browser. We do the heavy-lifting on cross platform compatibility so you don&rsquo;t have to. Featuring over 80%code  reuse across mobile apps, Titanium provides a deep, yet highly-reusable development platform. Appcelerator licenses Titanium under the Apache 2 license and is free for both personal and commercial use.    </p>\n<p>\nIn this chapter, you'll and learn the basics of writing cross-platform mobile apps with Titanium and become familiar with resources available to you. In addition, we'll take a brief look at the JavaScript skills you'll need to be an effective Titanium developer.    </p>\n<div class=\"section section-2 \" id=\"29004882_WelcomeToTitanium!-Sectionsinthischapter\">\n<h2 class=\"heading \"><span>Sections in this chapter</span></h2>\n<p>\n<strong class=\" \"><a class=\"document-link \" href=\"#!/guide/Titanium_Platform_Overview\" Titanium_Platform_Overview.html=\"Titanium_Platform_Overview.html\">What is Titanium Mobile?</a></strong> </p>\n<p>\nIn this section, you'll get your first look at Titanium's features and architecture.    </p>\n<p>\n<strong class=\" \"><a class=\"document-link \" href=\"#!/guide/Hello_World\" Hello_World.html=\"Hello_World.html\">Hello World</a></strong> </p>\n<p>\nNext, you'll examine the Titanium version of a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; project.
