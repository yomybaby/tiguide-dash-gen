<h1>Welcome To Titanium!</h1>
<p>
Titanium's unique trait among the various available cross-platform mobile solutions is that it creates truly native apps. This is in contrast to web-based solutions that deliver functionality via an enhanced web view. Titanium, not wanting to be limited by the native web view, has engaged in a much deeper integration with the underlying platforms. This gives Titanium developers the ability to leverage native UI components &amp; services, as well as near-native performance, features you won't find in other cross-platform mobile development solution. In addition, you'll have access to other features like:    </p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" "> <p>
Platform specific APIs    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
Location-based services    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
Social sharing    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
Rich multimedia    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>

</li><li class=" "> <p>
Extensibility    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
and much more!    </p>
</li></ul> <p>
Titanium empowers you to create immersive, full-featured applications that go beyond the boundaries of the browser. We do the heavy-lifting on cross platform compatibility so you don&rsquo;t have to. Featuring over 80%code  reuse across mobile apps, Titanium provides a deep, yet highly-reusable development platform. Appcelerator licenses Titanium under the Apache 2 license and is free for both personal and commercial use.    </p>
