<h2 class="heading "><span>Titanium Mobile Best Practices</span></h2>
<p>
Though both Titanium Mobile and JavaScript are highly flexible, we have found that certain approaches lead to better outcomes. As a guide, we look for techniques that achieve these goals:    </p>
<ol class=" "><li class=" "> <p>
Stable &ndash; applications must be stable when published and available to the market.    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
Rapid &ndash; applications must be rapid to develop, maintain, and update.    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
Performant &ndash; applications must perform optimally, approaching 1:1 native speed on targeted devices.    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
Readable &ndash; applications must have a readable codebase for quick understanding, modification, and improvement.    </p>
</li></ol> <div class="section section-3 " id="30082360_BestPracticesandRecommendations-Doesbest-practicereallymeanonly-practice?">
<h3 class="heading "><span>Does best-practice really mean only-practice?</span></h3>
<p>
In the general sense, no. However, the contents of this guide are distilled from the experience and practices of Appcelerator's Professional Services engineers with input from the Engineering department, Developer Relations team, Training department, and of course our many supportive customers.    </p>
