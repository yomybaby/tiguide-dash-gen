<h1>Reviewing pull requests</h1>
<p>
An important way you can help move Titanium forward is to review the changes that others have submitted. Proper functional testing helps us merge changes more quickly and with more confidence.    </p>
<p>
This document describes the process you can follow to test any of the &quot;NPM-installable&quot; projects, including Alloy and the CLI. While you could test PRs for the Titanium SDK itself, that would also involve <a class="document-link " href="#!/guide/Building_the_Titanium_SDK_From_Source" Building_the_Titanium_SDK_From_Source.html="Building_the_Titanium_SDK_From_Source.html">Building the Titanium SDK From Source</a> which is covered elsewhere in the documentation.     </p>
<div class="section section-2 " id="37551424_Reviewingpullrequests-One-timesetup:">
<h2 class="heading "><span>One-time setup:</span></h2>
<ol class=" "><li class=" "> <p>
Clone the project repo to a local directory. For example, for Alloy you would use <tt class=" ">git clone https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy.git</tt> (you can't do this with your fork of the project)    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
In the resulting directory, open the <strong class=" ">.git/config</strong> file in your text editor.    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
Follow the instructions at <a class="external-link external-link" href="https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally" target="_blank">https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally</a> to modify your git configuration to support fetching pull requests    </p>
</li></ol> <p>
<span style="color: #000000;">
Checkout a PR    </span>
</p>
<p>
GitHub for Mac (or Windows) users, you'll see a button to check out the PR directly from the GitHub repo page. This will work only if you have write access to the repo. (You can check out <a class="external-link external-link" href="https://github.com/blog/1582-checking-out-pull-requests" target="_blank">https://github.com/blog/1582-checking-out-pull-requests</a> for more details.) Sorry, you're going to have to use the command-line for this:    </p>
<ol class=" "><li class=" "> <p>
Update your local repo with <tt class=" ">git fetch origin</tt> (which will also fetch all the PRs).    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
Check out the specific PR using <tt class=" ">git checkout pull/origin/999 -b 999</tt> where 999 is the PR number (the -b 999 creates a new local branch named after the PR)    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
Install from your local branch: [<tt class=" ">sudo]</tt><tt class=" "> npm install -g .</tt> (with the dot at the end). You&rsquo;re ready now to do your testing, etc.    </p>
</li></ol> <p>
<span style="color: #000000;">
Functional Review testing    </span>
</p>
<p>
Tickets should contain a description of what steps should be followed to review the changes. Alloy tickets, for example, should note a sample app (either attached to the PR or to the ticket). Run that app and confirm it displays the expected behavior.    </p>
<p>
Optionally, you could build one of your own projects with the PR version. This could uncover issues that might be missed by the simple test case app included on the ticket.    </p>
<p>
When you're done, add a comment on the ticket (preferred) or pull request. If all works fine, a simple &quot;FR passes&quot; comment will suffice. If there are errors or if the feature doesn't work as expected, please post detailed comments including any error messages    </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #000000;">
Post FR cleanup    </span>
</p>
<ol class=" "><li class=" "> <p>
Install the release version again. E.g. [<tt class=" ">sudo]</tt><tt class=" "> npm install -g alloy</tt> </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
Switch to your master branch: <tt class=" ">git checkout master</tt> </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
Finally, force-delete your local PR branch: <tt class=" ">git branch -D 999</tt> (this will destroy any changes you made to the files)    </p>
</li></ol> <p>
<span style="color: #000000;">
Alloy's jake app runner    </span>
</p>
<p>
Alloy includes the jake (JavaScript make) utility, which you can use this to run any of the PR test apps, as well as the sample/demo apps included in the repo. For example, from your local Alloy repo directory:    </p>
<pre class=" ">jake app:run dir=ALOY-1234 // to run the app in test/apps/testing/ALOY-1234<br />jake app:run dir=basics/simple // to run the test/apps/basics/simple demo app</pre><pre class=" ">// additional command-line options are:<br />platform=android   // to build for android,ios,mobileweb,blackberry<br />tiversion=3.2.2.GA  // to build using a specific SDK version (must match tiapp.xml)(<br />tisdk=&lt;path_to_sdk&gt;</pre><pre class=" ">// e.g.<br />jake app:run dir=ALOY-1234 platform=android tiversion=3.2.2.GA</pre> <p>
The resulting app will be installed to your simulator/emulator under the name <strong class=" ">Harness</strong>. You can import the Harness app into Studio to build for other platforms, install to device, etc. The Harness app is wiped with each jake app:run command.    </p>
