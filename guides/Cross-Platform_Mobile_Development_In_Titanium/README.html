<h1>Cross-Platform Mobile Development In Titanium</h1>
<p>
Titanium does much more than just build apps that run on multiple platforms. Its true power comes from how it helps you build <i class=" ">best of breed</i>, <i class=" ">native</i> apps that take full advantage of the platforms on which they run. By this, we mean apps that:    </p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" "> <p>
Use hardware-specific features, such as the Android menu button    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
Use OS-specific controls, such as the Cocoa UI controls on iOS    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
Participate in the platform ecosystem, for example using platform-appropriate notification mechanisms    </p>
</li></ul> <p>
Your Titanium apps should do more than just run on iOS and Android. When running on an iOS device, your app should <i class=" ">feel</i> like an iOS app. Your Android app should <i class=" ">feel</i> like an Android app.    </p>
<p>
In this chapter, we'll take a look at strategies for writing best-of-breed apps. You'll learn a variety of techniques for creating scalable, performant cross platform mobile projects. Finally, you'll learn how to increase the accessibility of your apps with internationalization.    </p>
