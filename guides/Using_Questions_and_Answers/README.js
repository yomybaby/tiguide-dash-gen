We use it ourselves, to discover the main concerns troubling the community, and also to take part in the discussion. Crucially, its made possible by having such capable and generous members willing to give their time to help others.    </p>\n<p>\nAs it is the first place they usually go when they need assistance, the Q&amp;A and its community is one of the things that makes Titanium accessible for new users. Without it, the learning-curve can be too steep. Consequently, it plays a direct role in the community's growth.    </p>\n<p>\nYou may think that the Q&amp;A is primarily dependent on those who help. Indeed, these people are vital. However, it's the quality of information in the questions that drives it. For instance, unless a question is given an informative and relevant title, how will anyone find it in the future? More to the point, how will <i class=\" \">you</i> find it in future?    </p>\n<p>\nWhen you have been using the Q&amp;A for some time, you may notice a recurring trend, which is that some questions get answered almost immediately, while others are left with no responses at all.    </p>\n<p>\nSo, what is the secret of getting answers?    </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section section-2 \" id=\"29004879_UsingQuestionsandAnswers-Jumpingthequeue\">\n<h2 class=\"heading \"><span>Jumping the queue</span></h2>\n<p>\nWhen people help out in the Q&amp;A, it's often a spontaneous gesture. Thus, they are likely to be more drawn to questions where they can determine at a glance that they know the answer or where they have an interest in the topic.    </p>\n<div class=\"confbox admonition admonition-tip aui-message success shadowed information-macro\">\n<p>\nTip: Grab attention, by creating a question title that directly relates to your core issue, in the form of a question that can be easily answered.    </p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIn spite of their unwavering good nature, Helpers in the Q&amp;A like an easy life just as much as anybody else. They won't always have the time to read through long accounts of the frustrations you feel you have endured while attempting to get something to work. If they cannot quickly comprehend the issue or question, they may simply move on to the next one. Hence:    </p>\n<div class=\"confbox admonition admonition-tip aui-message success shadowed information-macro\">\n<p>\nTip: Stay on topic - explain your problem concisely, but in full.    </p>\n</div>\n<p>\nYour question is competing with many others for the attention of a Helper, so they aren't likely to wait around long enough to request information you've left out. Even if they do, do you really want the delay?    </p>\n<div class=\"confbox admonition admonition-tip aui-message success shadowed information-macro\">\n<p>\nTip: Include all the relevant information in your original post. See section below.    </p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIf you include some code that demonstrates your issue, you not only increase your chances of getting an answer, but also of getting the correct answer more quickly.    </p>\n<div class=\"confbox admonition admonition-tip aui-message success shadowed information-macro\">\n<p>\nTip: include a test case; see <a class=\"document-link \" href=\"#!/guide/How_to_Submit_a_Bug_Report-section-29004732_HowtoSubmitaBugReport-CreatingaTestCase\" How_to_Submit_a_Bug_Report.html#29004732_HowtoSubmitaBugReport-CreatingaTestCase=\"How_to_Submit_a_Bug_Report.html#29004732_HowtoSubmitaBugReport-CreatingaTestCase\">Creating a Test Case</a> for guidelines. It's important to wrap it in a markdown code delimiter, &quot;~~~&quot;, to create a code block, otherwise your post will be very difficult to read. Use an online media sharing websites, such as <a class=\"external-link external-link\" href=\"http://imageshack.us/\" target=\"_blank\">imageshack</a> and <a class=\"external-link external-link\" href=\"http://www.nippyzip.com\" target=\"_blank\">nippyzip</a>, to include any assets required to make it work.    </p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIf your problem produces an error or exception, there is no need to attempt to explain it. By including the verbatim message in your question, you give Helpers a much better insight into the issue.    </p>\n<div class=\"confbox admonition admonition-tip aui-message success shadowed information-macro\">\n<p>\nTip: always include any error or exception messages by copying and pasting rather than explaining it. If it is long, use a <a class=\"external-link external-link\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_pastebins\" target=\"_blank\">pastebin</a> service.    </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"confbox admonition admonition-tip aui-message success shadowed information-macro\">\n<p>\nTip: always include the trace log for the emulator or device.    </p>\n</div>\n<p>\nDid you know that people can have new questions delivered to them via email, by subscribing to specific tags in the <a class=\"external-link external-link\" href=\"http://developer.appcelerator.com/questions/tag\" target=\"_blank\">Popular Tags</a> cloud? Hence, those expert in iphone-related matters may subscribe to the <a class=\"external-link external-link\" href=\"http://developer.appcelerator.com/questions/tag/iphone\" target=\"_blank\">iphone</a> tag and those who know about network issues may subscribe to the <a class=\"external-link external-link\" href=\"http://developer.appcelerator.com/questions/tag/httpclient\" target=\"_blank\">httpclient</a> and <a class=\"external-link external-link\" href=\"http://developer.appcelerator.com/questions/tag/xhr\" target=\"_blank\">xhr</a> tags. Therefore, if you want your question to reach the relevant people, you should set quality tags when you post it.    </p>\n<div class=\"confbox admonition admonition-tip aui-message success shadowed information-macro\">\n<p>\nTip: reach a wider audience by setting some relevant question tags. At the very least, they should describe your mobile platform and Titanium SDK version.    </p>\n</div>\n<p>\nUsing the &quot;Mark as the best answer&quot; option to close your question helps everyone to find reliable answers later on, as the question will be highlighted with a green badge making it easier to spot in the search results. Furthermore, it enables you to show your appreciation for a Helper's time and effort by awarding them Q&amp;A points. They will no doubt recall your good turn when they see your name in the list of questions next time.    </p>\n<p>\nEven if no answers provided an exact solution, don't be mean! Under the answer that inspired you most to figure it out for yourself, add a comment explaining the actual solution and then mark it as &quot;best&quot;.    </p>\n<div class=\"confbox admonition admonition-tip aui-message success shadowed information-macro\">\n<p>\nTip: for each of your questions, add a comment to the closest answer, giving the actual solution, and then mark it as best. Consider using the <a class=\"external-link external-link\" href=\"http://developer.appcelerator.com/questions/myqa\" target=\"_blank\">My Q&amp;A</a> link to review your old questions, and see if any more can be closed in this way.    </p>\n</div>\n<p>\nLastly, voting up or down helps give a visual guide to the usefulness of questions, and improves the sort order of answers within a question thread.    </p>\n<div class=\"confbox admonition admonition-tip aui-message success shadowed information-macro\">\n<p>\nTip: Cast your votes!    </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"confbox admonition admonition-note aui-message warning shadowed information-macro\">\n<p>\nWhile voting is important, sometimes people perceive a vote <i class=\" \">down</i> as personal criticism. In order to maintain an atmosphere of goodwill, if you are the first person to cast a vote downwards, always help the author to understand their mistake by providing a written reason in a friendly tone. A lot of the time, &quot;bad&quot; posts are not malicious or intended, and a nudge in the right direction can work wonders.    </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section section-2 \" id=\"29004879_UsingQuestionsandAnswers-Q&amp;AQuestionChecklist\">\n<h2 class=\"heading \"><span>Q&amp;A Question Checklist</span></h2>\n<p>\n</p>\n<div class=\"confbox admonition admonition-info aui-message hint shadowed information-macro\">\n<p>\nIf you have been directed to this section after posting a question to the Q&amp;A, it probably means that you have omitted some vital information.
