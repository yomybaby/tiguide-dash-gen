We'll focus on those that are troubleshooting related in this section, specifically DDMS and <tt class=\" \">adb</tt>. DDMS (Dalvik Debug Manager Service) is a GUI tool that you can use to monitor and manage Android emulators and devices. <tt class=\" \">adb</tt> is a command-line utility that does most of what DDMS does, plus offers a few tricks that DDMS can't do. We'll explore them separately.    </p>\n<div class=\"section section-3 \" id=\"29004938_NativeAndroidDebuggingandTestingTools-AccessingtheemulatorwithDDMS\">\n<h3 class=\"heading \"><span>Accessing the emulator with DDMS</span></h3>\n<p>\nIn this part, you'll see how to use DDMS to:    </p>\n<ul class=\" \"><li class=\" \"> <p>\nView log output    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nAccess the file system on the emulator or device    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nSet emulator parameters and simulate operating conditions    </p>\n</li></ul> <div class=\"section section-4 \" id=\"29004938_NativeAndroidDebuggingandTestingTools-ExamininglogoutputwithDDMS\">\n<h4 class=\"heading \"><span>Examining log output with DDMS</span></h4>\n<p>\nYou can view emulator or device log output using DDMS. Open DDMS and select the device or emulator in the top-left pane. Log output is displayed in the lower pane, as shown in the screenshot below.    </p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"images/download/attachments/29004938/ddmslog.png\" alt=\"images/download/attachments/29004938/ddmslog.png\" class=\"confluence-embedded-image\" width=\"600\" />\n</p>\n<p>\nDDMS shows all log output, not just messages from Titanium. Sometimes you need to view all those operating system messages. But in most cases, you will want to filter output to show just Titanium logging output (that output with <tt class=\" \">Ti.API.info()</tt> and so forth). With DDMS, you can define a filter. As shown in the graphic, click the <strong class=\" \">Add Filter</strong> button, then enter <strong class=\" \">TiAPI</strong> in the Log Tag field. Click OK to save your filter. Then click it in the list to apply it to the log output.    </p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"images/download/attachments/29004938/ddmsfilter.png\" alt=\"images/download/attachments/29004938/ddmsfilter.png\" class=\"confluence-embedded-image\" width=\"500\" />\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section section-4 \" id=\"29004938_NativeAndroidDebuggingandTestingTools-Simulatingnetworkconditions\">\n<h4 class=\"heading \"><span>Simulating network conditions</span></h4>\n<p>\nYou should test your app under less-than-ideal conditions so that you know how it will react as users go into roaming mode, operate over low-speed data networks, and so forth. For example, many users turn off data when they're roaming. If they run your app in such a state, your app should react appropriately rather than crashing. You can simulate such conditions with DDMS. With the emulator running, select the instance in the top-left pane and then click <strong class=\" \">Emulator Control</strong>. In the Telephony Status section, specify voice and data location state (e.g. roaming vs. searching for a signal vs. on their carrier's home network), and data speed and latency.    </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section section-4 \" id=\"29004938_NativeAndroidDebuggingandTestingTools-SimulatingcallsandSMSmessages\">\n<h4 class=\"heading \"><span>Simulating calls and SMS messages</span></h4>\n<p>\nYou can simulate a call or text message to determine how your app will react to such interruptions. (For example, with a game, you'd want to pause your game so that the player's status doesn't change while they answer a phone call.) With the emulator running, select the instance in the top-left pane and then click <strong class=\" \">Emulator Control</strong>. Scroll down to the Telephony Actions section. Enter a phone number (without any punctuation), select Voice or SMS, enter an optional SMS message, and click Call.    </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section section-4 \" id=\"29004938_NativeAndroidDebuggingandTestingTools-SettingGPScoordinates\">\n<h4 class=\"heading \"><span>Setting GPS coordinates</span></h4>\n<p>\nThe Android emulator doesn't provide a default simulated location so GPS lookups of the current location will fail. You can set a current location with DDMS. With the emulator running, select the instance in the top-left pane and then click <strong class=\" \">Emulator Control</strong>. Scroll down to the Location Controls section. Enter longitude and latitude coordinates and click Send. This transmits the mock coordinates to the emulator, which will be used for &quot;my location&quot; type lookups until the emulator is stopped.    </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section section-4 \" id=\"29004938_NativeAndroidDebuggingandTestingTools-ExploringthefilesystemwithDDMS\">\n<h4 class=\"heading \"><span>Exploring the file system with DDMS</span></h4>\n<p>\nIf your app manipulates files, you might want to explore the file system in order to confirm that the files are being created or deleted as you expect. With DDMS, select the emulator or device to examine in the top-left pane, then from the Device menu, choose File System.    </p>\n<p>\nYou can copy files to the emulator/device by dragging and dropping files into the File Explorer window. Alternatively, select the target location in File Explorer and click the Push File Onto Device button in the File Explorer's toolbar. A file-picker dialog opens in which you can select the file to &quot;push&quot; (copy) to the device. To copy a file from the device or emulator, you must &quot;pull&quot; it from the device: select the file, then click the Pull File From Device button in the toolbar. To delete a file or folder, select it in the file tree then click the Delete (minus-sign) button in the toolbar.    </p>\n<p>\nNewer Android devices (running Android 4 / Ice Cream Sandwich) use the Android File Transfer application for transferring files, music, and photos to and from your computer. If installed, this application should launch automatically when you plug in or dock your device. You can use the Android File Transfer application to explore your device's handset, though it displays the contents of the SD card only (/mnt/sdcard). DDBMS and <tt class=\" \">adb</tt> enable you to access the entire file system.    </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section section-4 \" id=\"29004938_NativeAndroidDebuggingandTestingTools-MemorymonitoringwithDDMS\">\n<h4 class=\"heading \"><span>Memory monitoring with DDMS</span></h4>\n<p>\nDDMS offers monitoring features that work well for native Android developers who write their apps with Java. Those tools are less helpful for Titanium projects because the code you want to debug-<del class=\" \">your JavaScript</del>-is running within one of the many processes and therefore isn't &quot;visible&quot; to DDMS. Still, it can be helpful to watch memory totals to see if usage climbs as your app runs (possibly indicating a memory leak). These tools are also quite helpful if you're developing a native Android module for Titanium.    </p>\n<p>\nGoogle's Android docs cover the basics of using DDMS for monitoring memory usage. See <a class=\"external-link external-link\" href=\"http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/debugging/ddms.html#using-ddms\" target=\"_blank\">http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/debugging/ddms.html#using-ddms</a> for that. You'll also find a fair number of blog posts on the Internet from Java developers describing how they use DDMS for monitoring.    </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section section-3 \" id=\"29004938_NativeAndroidDebuggingandTestingTools-Accessingtheemulatorwithadb\">\n<h3 class=\"heading \"><span>Accessing the emulator with  adb</span></h3>\n<p>\n<tt class=\" \">adb</tt> offers many of the features of DDMS, including the means to:    </p>\n<ul class=\" \"><li class=\" \"> <p>\nView log output    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nAccess the file system on the emulator or device    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nAccess SQLite databases on the emulator or device    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nIssue shell commands on the emulator or device    </p>\n</li></ul> <div class=\"section section-4 \" id=\"29004938_NativeAndroidDebuggingandTestingTools-Examininglogoutputwithadb\">\n<h4 class=\"heading \"><span>Examining log output with adb</span></h4>\n<p>\nAs with DDMS, you can view the emulator or device log output using the <tt class=\" \">adb logcat</tt> command. If you have more than one emulator or device running, you'll need to supply an argument to the command to specify which device's log to output.    </p>\n<p>\n(The following are terminal commands, and those &quot;comments&quot; would cause errors. We're just using a code-like means of annotating what's happening in each step. So don't enter the // or what follows.)    </p>\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"confbox programlisting scroll-unprocessed\">\n<div class=\"defaultnew syntaxhighlighter\">\n<div class=\"line\"><code class=\"plain\">adb logcat \t\t</code><code class=\"comments\">// if you have just one device connected or emulator running</code></div>\n<div class=\"line\"><code class=\"plain\">adb -d logcat\t</code><code class=\"comments\">// for a USB-connected device</code></div>\n<div class=\"line\"><code class=\"plain\">adb -e logcat\t</code><code class=\"comments\">// for the emulator</code></div>\n<div class=\"line\"><code class=\"plain\">adb -s emulator-</code><code class=\"value\">5556</code><code class=\"plain\"> logcat\t</code><code class=\"comments\">// to target the emulator running on port 5556</code></div>\n</div>\n</div> <p>\nUse the <tt class=\" \">adb devices</tt> command to get a list of connected devices or emulators that you could target. Use the resulting device labels with the <tt class=\" \">adb -s</tt> command. In the examples below, we're omitting the device-targeting switches for simplicity's sake. You might need them in practice.    </p>\n<p>\n<tt class=\" \">logcat</tt> outputs in a continuous manner, meaning that the command continues to run and will output more messages as they're logged. To quit out of <tt class=\" \">logcat</tt> press <tt class=\" \">Ctrl+C</tt> on your keyboard. (Mac users take note, that's Control+C, not Command+C).    </p>\n<p>\nYou can filter log output by using the <tt class=\" \">grep</tt> command (OS X and Linux) or <tt class=\" \">findstr</tt> command (Windows). Better yet, just use the built-in <tt class=\" \">-s</tt> argument of the <tt class=\" \">logcat</tt> command. This technique works identically on both platforms. Titanium log statements are tagged with the &quot;TiAPI&quot; tag.    </p>\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"confbox programlisting scroll-unprocessed\">\n<div class=\"defaultnew syntaxhighlighter\">\n<div class=\"line\"><code class=\"plain\">adb logcat | grep TiAPI</code></div>\n<div class=\"line\"><code class=\"plain\">adb logcat -s TiAPI</code></div>\n</div>\n</div> <p>\nAlternative, you can follow the Android docs which say to use the <i class=\" \">tag</i>:<i class=\" \">priority</i> filtering option. This technique works just fine, but you need to include an extra argument that tells <tt class=\" \">logcat</tt> to suppress all the other messages:    </p>\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"confbox programlisting scroll-unprocessed\">\n<div class=\"title\">Displaying only Titanium logging messages</div>\n<div class=\"defaultnew syntaxhighlighter\">\n<div class=\"line\"><code class=\"plain\">adb logcat TiAPI:I *:S  </code><code class=\"comments\">// if you leave off the *:S you'll output the whole log</code></div>\n</div>\n</div> </div>\n<div class=\"section section-4 \" id=\"29004938_NativeAndroidDebuggingandTestingTools-Exploringthefilesystemwithadb\">\n<h4 class=\"heading \"><span>Exploring the file system with  adb</span></h4>\n<p>\nYou can copy files to and from an emulator or device using <tt class=\" \">adb</tt> and its commands. There isn't a built-in option to list the files on the device, but you can open a command shell and use a Linux-like <tt class=\" \">ls</tt> command.    </p>\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"confbox programlisting scroll-unprocessed\">\n<div class=\"title\">Listing files via the adb shell</div>\n<div class=\"defaultnew syntaxhighlighter\">\n<div class=\"line\"><code class=\"plain\">adb shell</code></div>\n<div class=\"line\"><code class=\"plain\"># ls -la\t</code><code class=\"comments\">// enter Linux-like commands, with or without options</code></div>\n<div class=\"line\"><code class=\"plain\"># cd /some/path\t</code><code class=\"comments\">// to change directories</code></div>\n<div class=\"line\"><code class=\"plain\"># exit\t\t</code><code class=\"comments\">// to close the adb shell</code></div>\n</div>\n</div> <p>\nWhen opening a shell on the emulator, you are logged in with root (superuser) permissions. On a device, you have limited permissions and will not be able to access the entire file system. If you have rooted your device and installed the <tt class=\" \">su</tt> binary, you can gain full access to your device's file system. Be careful to not change or delete any critical files or you could cause your device to stop functioning.    </p>\n<p>\nWhile you can &quot;walk&quot; the directory tree via the shell, you can't use it to copy files to and from the device/emulator. Instead, you'll need to use the <tt class=\" \">push</tt> and <tt class=\" \">pull</tt> commands.    </p>\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"confbox programlisting scroll-unprocessed\">\n<div class=\"title\">Pushing a file to the device/emulator</div>\n<div class=\"defaultnew syntaxhighlighter\">\n<div class=\"line\"><code class=\"plain\">adb push foo.txt /path_on_device/foo.txt</code></div>\n</div>\n</div><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"confbox programlisting scroll-unprocessed\">\n<div class=\"title\">Pulling a file from the device/emulator</div>\n<div class=\"defaultnew syntaxhighlighter\">\n<div class=\"line\"><code class=\"plain\">adb pull /path_on_device/foo.txt /local_path/foo.txt</code></div>\n</div>\n</div> </div>\n<div class=\"section section-4 \" id=\"29004938_NativeAndroidDebuggingandTestingTools-AccessingSQLitedatabaseswithadb\">\n<h4 class=\"heading \"><span>Accessing SQLite databases with  adb</span></h4>\n<p>\nOn the emulator and rooted devices, you can open an adb shell and run <tt class=\" \">sqlite3</tt> to access a command-line SQL shell. In this database shell, you can execute SQLite commands such as <tt class=\" \">SELECT * FROM yourtable</tt>. Not all Android systems ship with the <tt class=\" \">sqlite3</tt> binary installed. You'll get a &quot;not found&quot; error if the binary isn't available.    </p>\n<p>\nYou'll need to know the path to your app's database. According to Google's documentation, the path is <tt class=\" \">/data/data/com.example.yourapp/databases/yourdb.ext</tt>. The <tt class=\" \">yourdb.ext</tt> must match the file name you gave with the <tt class=\" \">Ti.Database.install()</tt> or <tt class=\" \">Ti.Database.open()</tt> statements within your app.    </p>\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"confbox programlisting scroll-unprocessed\">\n<div class=\"defaultnew syntaxhighlighter\">\n<div class=\"line\"><code class=\"plain\">adb shell</code></div>\n<div class=\"line\"><code class=\"plain\"># ls /data/data/com.example.yourapp/databases\t\t</code><code class=\"comments\">// to list the db files</code></div>\n<div class=\"line\"><code class=\"plain\"># sqlite3 /data/data/com.example.yourapp/databases/yourdb.sqlite</code></div>\n<div class=\"line\"><code class=\"plain\">sqlite&gt; SELECT * FROM yourtable;</code></div>\n<div class=\"line\"><code class=\"plain\">sqlite&gt; .exit</code></div>\n</div>\n</div> <p>\nKeep in mind these points:    </p>\n<ul class=\" \"><li class=\" \"> <p>\nOnly SQLite statements are supported, not the full SQL language.
