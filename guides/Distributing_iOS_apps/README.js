Apple provides three ways to distribute your application based on which developer program you are a member of:    </p>\n<ul class=\" \"><li class=\" \"> <p>\n<strong class=\" \">App Store or iTunes Store</strong>: Publish your application to the iTunes Store.    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\n<strong class=\" \">In House</strong>: Publish your application in house for your company's employees.  Members of the Apple Developer Enterprise program see this option instead of the App Store option.    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\n<strong class=\" \">Ad Hoc</strong>: Publish your application as a package that can be distributed on a limited number of devices for testing.    </p>\n</li></ul> <p>\nBoth work flows are similar except ad hoc distribution requires you to specify a list of devices when creating your provisioning profile and you need to specify two extra options (file format and location) when packaging your application with Studio.    </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section section-2 \" id=\"27595277_DistributingiOSapps-Contents\">\n<h2 class=\"heading \"><span>Contents</span></h2>\n<p>\nPublishing your iOS application involves a few, somewhat involved steps. Fortunately, you have done two of these steps already if you have deployed your app to a device for testing. The steps are:    </p>\n<ol class=\" \"><li class=\" \"> <p>\nRegister with the iOS Developer Center    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nCreate an App ID in the iOS Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles page    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nCreate and install the distribution certificate    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nCreate and install a distribution provisioning profile    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nBuild your app, embedding the distribution provisioning profile    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nUpload the app to iTunes Connect and kick-off the Apple review process <strong class=\" \">OR </strong>distribute your application package.    </p>\n</li></ol> <p>\n<img src=\"images/download/attachments/27595277/ios_publishing_process.png\" alt=\"images/download/attachments/27595277/ios_publishing_process.png\" class=\"confluence-embedded-image\" width=\"300\" />\n</p>\n<div class=\"section section-3 \" id=\"27595277_DistributingiOSapps-RegisteringandcreatingtheAppID\">\n<h3 class=\"heading \"><span>Registering and creating the App ID</span></h3>\n<p>\nBy now, you should have registered for the <a class=\"external-link external-link\" href=\"http://developer.apple.com\" target=\"_blank\">iOS developer program</a>. And you should have tested your app on a device, which means you've created an App ID on the iOS Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles page. If you plan to sell your app, rather than distribute it for free, you need to register on the iTunes Connect site and supply legal and banking information to Apple. They must verify your legal status and banking info. That process can take as much as a week or more.    </p>\n<p>\nAn App ID is a unique identifier for your app. It is composed of two parts: the App ID Prefix and the App ID Suffix. The App ID Prefix is a 10-character hexadecimal string generated by the iOS Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles page. It is unique to you and your developer account. The App ID Suffix is a name you enter called the Bundle Identifier.    </p>\n<p>\nThe Bundle Identifier can be explicit, meaning you enter a name on the iOS Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles page and enter that exact same identifier as the App ID of your application. You can also create a wildcard Bundle Identifier. Wildcard Bundle IDs are great for quick development &ndash; you do not have to create a new ID for each and every app you test. However, you cannot use some iOS features with a wildcard ID. You must create an explicit Bundle ID if you plan to use push notifications, iAd, or Game Center features.    </p>\n<p>\nSee <a class=\"document-link \" href=\"#!/guide/Deploying_to_iOS_devices-section-27595262_DeployingtoiOSdevices-CreateanAppID\" Deploying_to_iOS_devices.html#27595262_DeployingtoiOSdevices-CreateanAppID=\"Deploying_to_iOS_devices.html#27595262_DeployingtoiOSdevices-CreateanAppID\">Deploying to iOS devies: Create an App ID</a> for step-by-step instructions on creating an App ID.    </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section section-3 \" id=\"27595277_DistributingiOSapps-Createandinstallthedistributioncertificate\">\n<h3 class=\"heading \"><span>Create and install the distribution certificate</span></h3>\n<p>\nThe distribution certificate attests to the identity of the entity publishing the app. According to Apple: &quot;Only Team Agents are authorized to prepare and submit applications for distribution.&quot; The Team Agent is the person at your organization who oversees development and final distribution of your app. While each developer on your team could have their own developer certificate, you or your company will have a single distribution certificate. This arrangement enables you to add or remove people from your development team, while not giving those folks the means to publish your final app. That will be controlled by you.    </p>\n<p>\nThe Team Agent will be the user account associated with creation and first-logon to your provisioning portal account.    </p>\n<p>\nTo create a distribution certificate:    </p>\n<ol class=\" \"><li class=\" \"> <p>\nLog in to the <a class=\"external-link external-link\" href=\"https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Developer Member Center</a> as the Team Agent or Admin.    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nClick the link under <strong class=\" \">Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles</strong>.    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nClick <strong class=\" \">Certificates</strong>, then click the plus sign (+) button near the top-right corner.    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nSelect <strong class=\" \">App Store and Ad Hoc</strong>, then click <strong class=\" \">Continue</strong><strong class=\" \">.</strong> </p>\n</li><li class=\" \"> <p>\nFollow the directions to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).

To package your application for distribution, first select the project in the <strong class=\" \">Project Explorer</strong> view, then in the global tool bar, select  <strong class=\" \">Publish</strong> from the <strong class=\" \">Launch Mode</strong> drop-down list.

If the <strong class=\" \">Launch Automatically</strong> option is enabled under the<strong class=\" \"> Target</strong> drop-down list, the application will be automatically launched after the target is selected.  If not, you need to click the <strong class=\" \">Launch</strong> button to start the build process.    </p>\n<p>\nIf you have not previously distributed your app using Studio, you will see the following wizard dialog box. The wizard walks you through the necessary steps to build and distribute your app.    </p>\n<p>\nOn the <strong class=\" \">General</strong> page, ensure the requirements have been satisfied and select the desired SDK version. <u class=\" \"><strong class=\" \">For ad hoc and in-house distribution,</strong> </u> specify the package format as <strong class=\" \">ipa</strong> and a path to copy the package to.

To install the provisioning profile, click the <strong class=\" \">Browse...</strong> button, locate your .mobileprovision file, and click <strong class=\" \">Open</strong> to install that profile into Xcode.

For Ad Hoc distributions, the file is copied to the specified path.    </p>\n<p>\nIf you get errors, most likely source of trouble is that the app ID you entered in the tiapp.xml file doesn't match your distribution certificate and your provisioning file. Check each carefully to be sure that you're selecting the right requirements.    </p>\n<p>\nThe next time you execute the Distribute action, you will see a more simplified wizard where you specify the certificate, provisioning profile, and iOS SDK.

You can get to iTunes Connect from the Apple Developer Member Center site. If you have not done so yet, make sure to set up your iTunes Connect profile and supply the legal and banking information required by Apple.
