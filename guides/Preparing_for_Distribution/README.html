<h1>Preparing for Distribution</h1>
<p>
In this chapter, you'll look at how you can deploy and distribute your app. We have chosen to use the verb &quot;deploy&quot; to mean installing your app onto a device, either locally attached or remote, for the purposes of testing. We use &quot;distribute&quot; to mean publishing your app to the Market or App Store or some other means of general distribution.    </p>
