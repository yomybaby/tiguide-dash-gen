<h1>PyDev Useful tips</h1>
<p>
Ok, now that you're already up and running with PyDev, there are some useful tips presented below to make your coding more enjoyable:    </p>
<ul class="alternate "><li class=" "> <p>
<strong class=" ">Learn the keybindings provided by PyDev and Eclipse</strong>: As with any other environment, you'll have to learn what can be done (and how). In the reference manual, there is a session dedicated just to that...    </p>
</li></ul><ul class="alternate "><li class=" "> <p>
<strong class=" ">Search for what you need</strong>: Eclipse is a platform that has literally hundreds of plugins. If you want something that you are missing, search for it... you never know what you can find!    </p>
</li></ul><ul class="alternate "><li class=" "> <p>
If there is something you <strong class=" ">wish PyDev had</strong>, but it doesn't, drop a note at the <a class="external-link external-link" href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=85796&amp;atid=577332" target="_blank">feature request tracker</a>... who knows, it might be the next implemented feature         <img src="images/s/en_GB/5637/e1ef10868e8fe2f234a1a0b171b01cde1d9717c4.31/_/images/icons/emoticons/wink.png" alt="images/s/en_GB/5637/e1ef10868e8fe2f234a1a0b171b01cde1d9717c4.31/_/images/icons/emoticons/wink.png" class="emoticon emoticon-wink" />
</p>
</li></ul> <p>
And that's it... if you got here, you already 'graduated' to the 'intermediate level'... You can continue on to the reference manual, which will present you the features that are available within PyDev and give you much more information on how to effectively use your platform.    </p>
