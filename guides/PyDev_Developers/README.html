<div class="section section-2 " id="30083082_PyDevDevelopers-Gettingthecode">
<h2 class="heading "><span>Getting the code</span></h2>
<p>
The first thing you probably want to do in order to code in PyDev is <strong class=" ">getting its code</strong>.    </p>
<p>
<strong class=" ">Pre-requisites:</strong> Eclipse SDK 3.7.0, Git and Java 5.0 (note that other versions of those should work too but details may differ a bit)    </p>
<p>
Before getting the code, there's an important step you need to make: Change your java 'compiler compliance-level' to 5.0. To do this, go to <strong class=" ">window &gt; preferences &gt; Java &gt; compiler</strong> and change that setting from <strong class=" ">1.4 to 5.0</strong>.    </p>
<div class="section section-3 " id="30083082_PyDevDevelopers-Repository">
<h3 class="heading "><span>Repository</span></h3>
<p>
Get the code with Git from <a class="external-link external-link" href="https://github.com/aptana/Pydev" target="_blank">https://github.com/aptana/Pydev</a> (ideally, fork it at github, create your own branch at the forked repository -- usually based in the development branch -- and later send a pull request on github so that the code can be merged back). Later, if you want to provide some other feature/bugfix, a new branch should be created again.    </p>
<p>
Then, in Eclipse, go to: <strong class=" ">File &gt; Import &gt; Existing projects into workspace</strong> and point it to the root of the repository you just downloaded.    </p>
<p>
Note that currently PyDev has a project (org.python.pydev.red_core) which has a dependency on Aptana Studio 3, so, if you plan on doing a local build, you'll need to get Aptana Studio 3 installed as a plugin in the SDK used for the build (i.e.: not necessarily in the SDK you use for developing), now if you don't need to do a local build (i.e.: just do your local changes and run Eclipse with your changes from within the SDK and contribute that as a patch later on), you can just close this project so that it doesn't get compiled.    </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section section-2 " id="30083082_PyDevDevelopers-Configuringtheenvironmentaftergettingthecode">
<h2 class="heading "><span>Configuring the environment after getting the code</span></h2>
<p>
Important: Before doing any changes to the code it's important to  note that you should create a new branch (usually based on the development branch) for doing code changes. See: <a class="external-link external-link" href="http://book.git-scm.com/3_basic_branching_and_merging.html" target="_blank">http://book.git-scm.com/3_basic_branching_and_merging.html</a> and also <a class="external-link external-link" href="http://nvie.com/git-model" target="_blank">http://nvie.com/git-model</a> for details on creating and using branches.    </p>
<p>
<strong class=" ">Note</strong>: for running the tests, a file: <strong class=" ">org.python.pydev.core/tests/org.python.pydev.core/TestDependent.OS.properties</strong> must have the values set regarding to the computer that'll execute the tests.    </p>
<p>
If the head does not compile in git, send an e-mail to the pydev-code list at sourceforge to know what's  happening.    </p>
</div>
<div class="section section-2 " id="30083082_PyDevDevelopers-Wheretostart?">
<h2 class="heading "><span>Where to start?</span></h2>
<p>
Ok, this may be the most difficult thing... especially because  answers may change a lot depending on what you want to do, so, below are outlined 2 different approaches:    </p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" "> <p>
Extending PyDev <strong class=" ">with Jython</strong>: recommended if you  want to add some editor-related action or something that does not need  implementing some Eclipse extension-point.    </p>
</li></ul><ul class=" "><li class=" "> <p>
Extending PyDev <strong class=" ">in Java</strong>: if you want something that won't map to an action, this might be the better way to go.    </p>
</li></ul> <p>
To start in any of those approaches it might be worth taking a look  at some Eclipse documentation, to try to grasp some of its concepts. One  of the finest documentations for that is the <a class="external-link external-link" href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Eclipse_FAQs" target="_blank">Eclipse FAQ</a>.    </p>
<p>
If you want to take the Jython approach, check out this article on how to do <a class="document-link " href="#!/guide/PyDev_Jython_Scripting" PyDev_Jython_Scripting.html="PyDev_Jython_Scripting.html">jython scripting in PyDev</a> </p>
<p>
For supporting a new Python based language, the first step would be  creating a grammar that can parse it while providing a Python like AST. See: <a class="document-link " href="#!/guide/PyDev_Grammar" PyDev_Grammar.html="PyDev_Grammar.html">PyDev Grammar</a> for instructions on that.    </p>
<p>
And that's it. If you have further doubts about how to code in PyDev, direct your questions to the <a class="external-link external-link" href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pydev-code" target="_blank">pydev-code list</a> at sourceforge.    </p>
</div>
<div class="section section-2 " id="30083082_PyDevDevelopers-Creatingadistributionlocally">
<h2 class="heading "><span>Creating a distribution locally</span></h2>
<p>
Provided that the steps were followed, PyDev should have the following structure:    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
/builders<br />/org.python.pydev.build    </p>
<p>
/features<br />/org.python.pydev.feature    </p>
<p>
/plugins<br />/org.python.pydev<br />... (other plugins)    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now, on to the build: start a shell and follow the instructions at  /plugins/org.python.pydev.build/build_cmd.txt (read the end of the file  for details on customizing it properly)    </p>
