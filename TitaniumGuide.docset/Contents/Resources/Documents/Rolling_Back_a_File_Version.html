<h1>Rolling Back a File Version</h1>
<p>
You can roll back the version of a file in your projects to an earlier version by replacing the current file version with another version from the local file history.    </p>
<p>
To roll back the version of a file:    </p>
<ol class=" "><li class=" "> <p>
In the <strong class=" ">Project Explorer</strong> View, right-click on the file whose history you want to display, or right-click the file currently open in the editor.    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
From the pop-up context menu, select <strong class=" ">Replace With &gt; Local History...</strong> to open a <strong class=" ">Compare</strong> pop-up window. (To roll the file back only one version, you can select <strong class=" ">Replace With &gt; Previous from Local History</strong>, and Studio will automatically revert the file to the previously saved version.)    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
On the top part of the <strong class=" ">Compare</strong> window, select the date/time that corresponds to the version with which you want to replace the current version. You can preview the changes by double clicking the date/time, and Studio will display the changes in the bottom part of the window.    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
Click the <strong class=" ">Replace</strong> button to replace the current file with the selected version.    </p>
</li></ol> </div>
