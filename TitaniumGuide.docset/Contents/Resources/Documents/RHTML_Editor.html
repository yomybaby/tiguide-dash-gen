The Aptana Rails RHTML Editor is based on the Aptana HTML Editor. The RHTML Editor features context sensitive Code Assist, syntax coloring, and other standard Aptana Editor features. The RHTML Editor can determine whether you are coding in HTML, CSS Javascript or ERB ruby snippets within a file and acts accordingly. The Editor also offers Rails-specific code completion. It can recognize instance variables in the matching action, helper methods in the matching helper, and helper methods included by Rails.    </p>
