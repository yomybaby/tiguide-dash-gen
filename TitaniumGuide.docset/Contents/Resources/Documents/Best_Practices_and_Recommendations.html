<h2 class="heading "><span>Titanium Mobile Best Practices</span></h2>
<p>
Though both Titanium Mobile and JavaScript are highly flexible, we have found that certain approaches lead to better outcomes. As a guide, we look for techniques that achieve these goals:    </p>
<ol class=" "><li class=" "> <p>
Stable &#x2013; applications must be stable when published and available to the market.    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
Rapid &#x2013; applications must be rapid to develop, maintain, and update.    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
Performant &#x2013; applications must perform optimally, approaching 1:1 native speed on targeted devices.    </p>
</li><li class=" "> <p>
Readable &#x2013; applications must have a readable codebase for quick understanding, modification, and improvement.    </p>
</li></ol> <div class="section section-3 " id="30082360_BestPracticesandRecommendations-Doesbest-practicereallymeanonly-practice?">
<h3 class="heading "><span>Does best-practice really mean only-practice?</span></h3>
<p>
In the general sense, no. However, the contents of this guide are distilled from the experience and practices of Appcelerator&apos;s Professional Services engineers with input from the Engineering department, Developer Relations team, Training department, and of course our many supportive customers.    </p>
