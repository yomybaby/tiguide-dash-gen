<h1>Node.js Development</h1>
<p>
Node.js is a high-performance platform for developing networked applications, built on top of the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine.    </p>
<p>
Inside Titanium Studio, Node.js is used for a variety of external tools, including Alloy, the updated SDK command-line interface, and additional products.    </p>
<p>
Node.js will be installed by default on first run if you don&apos;t have it as a separate application. This allows for simple usage both inside and outside Studio. See the child pages for additional information on installing, upgrading and using Node.js.    </p>
