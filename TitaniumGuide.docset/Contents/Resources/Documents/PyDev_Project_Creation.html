<h1>PyDev Project Creation</h1>
<div class="section section-2 " id="30083048_PyDevProjectCreation-CreatingaProject">
<h2 class="heading "><span>Creating a Project</span></h2>
<p>
Ok, now that your interpreter is configured, it is time to <strong class=" ">create a project</strong>.    </p>
<p>
After opening Eclipse, go to the menu:<br><strong class=" ">file &gt; new &gt; project &gt; PyDev &gt; PyDev project</strong>. You should see the screen below:    </p>
<p>
<img src="images/pydev.org/images/new_project.png" alt="images/pydev.org/images/new_project.png" class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource confluence-content-image-border">
<br><strong class=" ">Project name</strong>: this is the name of the project.    </p>
<p>
<strong class=" ">Project contents</strong>: where it should be located.    </p>
<p>
<strong class=" ">Project type</strong>: defines the set of interpreters that will be available for that project.    </p>
<p>
<strong class=" ">Grammar version</strong>: the grammar used for parsing the files in this project. It doesn&apos;t have to match the grammar of the<br>actual interpreter selected. This is done so that you can use a newer interpreter while having the grammar you use<br>compatible with an older interpreter (e.g.: using a Python 2.6 interpreter with a Python 2.4 grammar in the project).    </p>
<p>
<strong class=" ">Interpreter</strong>: Defines which interpreter should be used for code-completion and default run configurations (note that<br>you can still create a run configuration with a different interpreter).    </p>
<p>
<strong class=" ">Create default &apos;src&apos; folder and add it to the pythonpath</strong>: If you don&apos;t leave that option checked, you&apos;ll have to create<br>the source folder(s) yourself after the project is created (which is covered in the next tutorial page).    </p>
<p>
You may finish in this screen or go to the next, where you will be asked which projects are referenced from this one.    </p>
</div>
<div class="section section-2 " id="30083048_PyDevProjectCreation-Referencedprojects">
<h2 class="heading "><span>Referenced projects</span></h2>
<p>
The referenced projects are the projects whose source folders are added to the PYTHONPATH for the<br>referrer project.    </p>
<p>
The <a class="document-link " href="#!/guide/PyDev_Project_Configuration" pydev_project_configuration.html="PyDev_Project_Configuration.html">next tutorial page</a> enters into more details on project references    </p>
</div>
<div class="section section-2 " id="30083048_PyDevProjectCreation-CreatingaProjectfromexistingsources">
<h2 class="heading "><span>Creating a Project from existing sources</span></h2>
<p>
If you <strong class=" ">created the project inside Eclipse</strong>, you just have to import the project again<br>(in <strong class=" ">files &gt; import &gt; general &gt; existing projects into workspace</strong>) &#x2013; it&apos;ll look for the existing .project<br>file and will configure it automatically from the existing configuration.    </p>
<p>
If you have the sources from an existing project that wasn&apos;t created in Eclipse, you have 2 options:    </p>
<ul class="alternate "><li class=" "> <p>
Create the project as if it was a new project, but leave the <strong class=" ">create default &apos;src&apos; folder</strong> option<br><strong class=" ">unchecked</strong> and point the location to the location of the sources (or a level above) &#x2013; the next tutorial page<br>will explain the steps to configure the PYTHONPATH (which should be done after creating the project this way).    </p>
</li></ul><ul class="alternate "><li class=" "> <p>
Create a new project in the default workspace and create a folder that&apos;s a <strong class=" ">link to your existing sources</strong>. Note<br>that this link folder must be added to the PYTHONPATH in the next step.    </p>
</li></ul> <p>
<strong class=" ">Note 1</strong>: <strong class=" ">links</strong> can be used <strong class=" ">above the source folder</strong> or <strong class=" ">as the source folder</strong>, but<br><strong class=" ">never inside a source folder</strong>, as it&apos;s not supported by PyDev)    </p>
<p>
<strong class=" ">Note 2</strong>: To create the folder as a link, choose the <strong class=" ">file &gt; new &gt; folder</strong> from the menu and in the new folder<br>dialog select the <strong class=" ">Advanced &gt;&gt;</strong> options.    </p>
<p>
<strong class=" ">Note 3</strong>: If the file structure you have is:    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
myproject<br>.../  _<i class=" ">init</i>_.py<br>.../  module.py    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p>
<p>
and you want to make the import:    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong class=" ">from myproject import module</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p>
<p>
you have to add to the project the <strong class=" ">folder above myproject</strong> (as the folder above myproject<br>will be your source folder &#x2013; as required by Python).    </p>
